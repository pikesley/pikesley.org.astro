<p>My Raspberry Pi finally arrived! Lego seems to be a popular choice for case-building, so last time I was at my parents', I dug out my old Lego and extracted all of the yellow pieces I could find. Some of these were extremely grubby, but it turns out that a couple of hours soaking in biological washing liquid is just the thing for getting rid of 35-year-old grime. And then of course I had to lay them out to dry:</p>

<p>I then found myself at a Lego store, where you can buy a half-pint pot of pick-and-mix Lego for 6 quid, so I picked up a few extra bits there. I also found a Lego Star Wars model that my niece and nephew had bought me a while ago (hence the Stormtrooper and big gun in the finished model above).</p>
<p>So armed with all of this Lego, I set about putting together a case.</p>
<p>The Pi fits nicely into a 10x10 square of Lego, leaving the connectors at either end exposed. So my base layer:</p>

{% include picture.html src = 'http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7084/7342155722_3f13ddb22b.jpg' link = 'http://www.flickr.com/photos/pikesley/7342155722/' caption = 'Base layer' float = 'left' %}

<p>The Pi sits on this, and is kept in place by a couple of pillars either side of the component-video connector (I don't currently intend to use this, or the audio-out connector, so these will not be exposed). Upper layers sit upon these pillars, holding the Pi very tightly in place:</p>

<p>The sides are now built up:</p>

<p>And then the top:</p>

<p>This is by no means my last Pi case (this one is not perfect, I have a lot more Lego, and I expect I'll buy more Pis when they become more widely available), but the 10x10 thing seems to be a good starting point for my next effort.</p>

<p>The entire photoset is <a title="Photos on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pikesley/sets/72157629997574737/" target="_blank">here</a>Â (on Flickr, which I've decided to give another go. Their new uploader is comically broken though, at least on this Chromeboook).</p>
