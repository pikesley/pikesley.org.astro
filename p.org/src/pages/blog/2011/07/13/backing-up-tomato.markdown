<p>I've recently starting running the excellent <a title="Tomato" href="https://www.polarcloud.com/tomato" target="_blank">Tomato</a> router firmware, and I was looking around for a way to back up my configuration. I came across Gregg Hansen's rather nice <a title="Gregg's bash script" href="https://www.thiscoolsite.com/?p=294" target="_blank">bash script</a>, but it didn't quite do what I was after so I started hacking it and then, as inevitably happens, I thought "You know what, this would be <em>so</em> much nicer in python".</p>
<p>And so I came up with <a title="Github" href="https://github.com/pikesley/tomato" target="_blank">this</a>.Â I realise it's is a longshot, but I hope <em>somebody </em>finds this useful.</p>
